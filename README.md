# XGDAG_Docker

XGDAG is a graph neural network tool for prioritizing disease-associated genes: [original repo](https://github.com/GiDeCarlo/XGDAG). While working with it during the [CeNT Bio-AI hackathon](https://github.com/SFGLab/Team1_Gene_Prioritization_GNN), we ran into environment issues that made it difficult to run across systems. To address this, I created a working Docker setup along with a couple of minimal fixes. 

The original hackathon repository is now archived in connection with an upcoming BioHackrXiv preprint. Any further updates & fixes will be maintained here. Suggestions welcome! If this setup proves useful in your work, feel free to cite the preprint (link to follow). This repository includes:

- a `Dockerfile` (in two versions)
- instructions for building and using the container (see below)
